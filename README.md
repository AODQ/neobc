# NeoBC

Basically my personal specialized library for BetterC.  It exists because many
portions of Phobos relies on D runtime and/or garbage collection. Neither are
something I feel comfortable with on a few D projects I work on.

NeoBC is currently actively used in [dtrl](https://github.com/aodq/dtrl)
